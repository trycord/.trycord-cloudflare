// Conversation keys: one key per conversation, sealed to each member device,
// and rekeyed whenever the membership changes.
//
// The server holds the conversation's key in the only form it can hold:
// sealed, one seal per member device. A member device opens its own seal
// with its identity key and gets the key; nobody else can, including the
// server and including the other members.
//
// A membership change mints a new epoch and a new key. The seals of the
// previous epoch are kept rather than deleted, because a device that has not
// caught up has to be told which epoch it is missing - a client that simply
// found nothing would have no way to tell a new conversation from a key it
// was not given.
//
// The epoch is what the server enforces: a key published again at the epoch
// that is already current has to be sealed to the same set of devices, so a
// member who left - and still holds the key they were given - is only cut
// off when the epoch moves.
